The following repo contains R and Python scripts to download images from iNaturalist and Google Street View.

The inat_img_dler.R script downloads images of tree genera from iNaturalist.

The get_panos_and_metadata_async_csv.py script downloads panoramic Google Street View images. A sample .csv file with latitude and longitude coordinates 'tiny_25m_near_samples.csv' can be used with the script to download images, given locations along roads.
